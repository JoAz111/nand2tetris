Finally getting around to one of the more interesting projects i've done. I'm going to be building a computer from scratch, using just an elementary NAND gate. Over the span of 12 projects i'll be walking through the book "The Elements of Computing Systems, By Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken (MIT Press)" and building both hardware and software components to create a fully functional computer. 

I will update this repository with every project and a brief description of each project.

## Project 1
The first project involved building multiple elementary logic gates from a basic NAND gate. These gates increase in complexity.

## Project 2
The second project involved building chips starting at a half adder, all the way to a full Arithmetic Logic Unit capable of binary arithmetic. The ALU will be an integral part of the computer's CPU.

## Project 3
The second project consisted of creating sequential logic gates in order to build a 16K RAM chip. Started with an arbitrary Flip-flop gate and built a 1 bit chip from that. Then I built a 16 bit Register. With the Register I proceeded to build an 8-bit RAM Chip which I stacked into a 64-bit, 512-bit, 4K and 16K RAM chip respectiveley. Finally I implemented a counter that increments it's value every time unit (cycle).
